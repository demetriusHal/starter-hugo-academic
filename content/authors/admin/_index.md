I'm Dimitris and I am an MS graduate of Computer Science from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). My studies where mostly in theoretical computer science and data science. In my MS thesis I worked with [Grigoris](https://grigorisg9gr.github.io/) and [Volkan Cevher](https://people.epfl.ch/volkan.cevher?lang=en) on properties of deep polynomial neural networks.

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science with an emphasis on theoretical foundations of machine learning and big data analysis.

Besides CS I'm an adventure enthusiast who enjoys mountain hikes, camping and bike touring.
